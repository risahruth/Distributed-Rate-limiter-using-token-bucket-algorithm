# Distributed-Rate-limiter-using-token-bucket-algorithm
This is a java project implementing rate limiting system to control API requests to prevent system overloading and for traffic control.
Problem : Multiple requests at a time can lead to several problems such as resource abuse or DOS(Denial Of Service) attacks, bot attackes, cyberattacks, server overloading and various other issues. So inorder to prevent all the issues, Rate limiting is used. This prevents the number of requests being sent to the server at a time. This uses a lot of different algorithm. But the algorithm I have chosen to work with in this project is token bucket algorithm.
Other details: Project scope, Architechture diagram, tech stack such details have been added to the docs folder of this repository.
